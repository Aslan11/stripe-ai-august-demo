# Implementation Plan: Temporal Agentic AI Invoice Approval System

## Overview

This implementation integrates **Temporal’s OpenAI Agents SDK (Python)** with **Stripe’s Invoice API and Stripe’s Agent Toolkit** to create a demo for **AI August**. The goal is to automate invoice approvals under a threshold (e.g., \$500) and escalate larger invoices for human review. Key features include:

* Automated invoice generation
* AI-driven invoice evaluation
* Threshold-based auto-approval
* Human-in-the-loop signaling
* Stripe API integration for invoicing via Stripe’s Agent Toolkit
* Optional fraud checks (Stripe Radar)
* Real-time web UI dashboard

## Development Setup

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as its Python package manager.

1. Install `uv` by following the instructions in its documentation.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Run the test suite:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m pytest
   ```

## System Architecture

### Components

* **Invoice Generation Service**: Simulates or retrieves invoice data.
* **Temporal Workflow (Invoice Processor)**: Orchestrates invoice evaluation, approval, and escalation.
* **AI Agent (OpenAI Agents SDK)**: Decides on invoice approvals.
* **Stripe Invoice API Integration (Stripe Agent Toolkit)**: Manages invoice creation, finalization, and cancellation.
* **Human Review via Signals & Queries**: Handles escalation and manual approvals.
* **Fraud Detection (Optional)**: Uses Stripe Radar for additional checks.
* **Web UI Dashboard**: Monitors invoice statuses and logs agent decisions.

### Integration Points

* **Temporal Python SDK**: Workflow orchestration.
* **OpenAI Agents SDK Integration**: Durable, fault-tolerant agent execution.
* **Stripe Agent Toolkit and Stripe Python SDK/API**: Enhanced agent-based invoice management and processing.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Invoice Generation Service

* Set up simulated invoice data generation or Stripe test-mode invoices.
* Regular or on-demand workflow triggers.

### 2. Temporal Workflow for Invoice Processing

* Define workflow to manage invoice lifecycle.
* Integrate AI agent using Stripe’s Agent Toolkit to evaluate invoices based on defined thresholds.
* Implement workflow logic for auto-approval or human escalation.
* Use Temporal signals for human decisions.

### 3. Auto-Approval & Stripe Integration

* Finalize invoices below threshold using Stripe’s Agent Toolkit.
* Log approvals and update status.

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop via Signals

* Implement Temporal signals (`ApproveInvoice`, `RejectInvoice`).
* Design UI interactions for manual approval/rejection.
* Handle invoice finalization or cancellation based on human input.

### 5. Optional Fraud Check with Stripe Radar

* Integrate optional fraud detection activities using Stripe Radar.
* Escalate invoices flagged as high risk regardless of amount.

### 6. Web UI for Monitoring and Interaction

* Real-time dashboard showing invoice statuses and agent actions.
* Detailed logs for agent decisions and human interactions.
* UI controls for manual invoice approvals and rejections.

## Step-by-Step Workflow Execution

1. **Invoice Generation:** New invoice created (e.g., \$300).
2. **AI Evaluation:** Agent evaluates invoice against threshold using Stripe’s Agent Toolkit.
3. **Auto-approval:** Invoice below threshold approved automatically.
4. **Stripe Finalization:** Invoice finalized via Stripe’s Agent Toolkit.
5. **Human Escalation:** Invoices above threshold paused for manual review.
6. **Human Approval/Rejection:** Workflow resumes based on human signal.
7. **Fraud Check (optional):** Additional checks trigger escalation if necessary.
8. **Web UI Logging:** Displays real-time invoice processing updates.

## Architecture Summary

* Combines Temporal’s durable execution and OpenAI’s agent-driven decisions.
* Utilizes Stripe’s Agent Toolkit and API for realistic invoicing demonstration.
* Balances automated AI decisions with human oversight.
* Demonstrates flexible integration and extensibility through optional fraud checks.

By following this structured approach, the demo effectively showcases the capabilities of Temporal and AI agents in automating complex workflows with human-in-the-loop interactions.
